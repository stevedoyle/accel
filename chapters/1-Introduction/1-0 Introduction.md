# Introduction

[TODO]: Update the intro.

Most workloads have reasonable performance when running on general purpose CPUs but some workloads could run faster on specialized processing units called accelerators. Accelerators can range from small co-processors, to PCIe attached devices to GPUs.

While using an accelerator can lead to workload improvements, care must be taken to select the most suitable accelerator for the workload. Using an accelerator may also require special programming models.
