# Estimating Performance

## Amdahls Law

[TODO]: Brief overview of Amdahls law.

## Performance Benefit Upper Bound

[TODO]: Use Amdahls law to determine the maximum speedup that an accelerator can bring to a workload.

## Real World Performance Benefit

- Explain why the upper bound performance is usually not achievable.
- Give some examples of items that can reduce the benefit.
- Use Amdahls law to show some curves showing the tradeoffs and impacts of overheads.

## Systematic Approach

- Define a systematic approach to generating a first order estimate of the seedup that an accelerator can bring to a workload.
